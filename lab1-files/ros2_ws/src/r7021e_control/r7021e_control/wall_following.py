    reaches: point at the nearest wall and drive at it. Without this, a distant wall
    and a near wall produce the same capped turn rate, so the robot holds a constant
    speed and turn rate indefinitely -- a circle that never reaches a wall.

    Following, when a wall is within reach and nothing is close in front:

        omega = side_sign * (k_p * (distance - setpoint) - k_heading * psi)

    Two proportional terms: distance error, and heading error from wall_geometry().
