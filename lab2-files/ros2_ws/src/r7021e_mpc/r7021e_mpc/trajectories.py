"""The figure of eight, as a function of time.

No ROS imports, so the path can be plotted and unit tested without a robot.
trajectory_node.py turns what this returns into a geometry_msgs/Pose.

Gerono lemniscate:

    x(s) = centre_x + width  * sin(s)
    y(s) = centre_y + height * sin(2s)          s = 2*pi * (elapsed / lap_period)

The double frequency in y makes the curve cross itself once, at the centre, giving a
figure of eight that spans exactly 2*width by 2*height.

Path properties at width=1.0, height=0.5 (config/trajectory.yaml defaults), computed
from the curve:

    arc length          6.097 m per lap
    tightest radius     0.209 m, at the crossing
    mean speed          0.122 m/s at a 50 s lap
    peak speed          0.175 m/s (80% of the Burger's 0.22 m/s limit)
    peak turn rate      0.40 rad/s (14% of the Burger's 2.84 rad/s limit)

The turn rate figure is a floor, not a ceiling: it's what the path itself demands of
something already on it. NID divides lateral tracking error by L, so a robot that
isn't exactly on the path demands more.
